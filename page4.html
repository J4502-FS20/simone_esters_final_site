    <h3>How did you get into twirling?</h3>
<p>Sabrina: I started twirling when I was 5. My aunt was a baton twirler her whole life and she is a coach. I used to go with her to the gyms to practices and from the first practice I went with her to I was hooked. I’ve been twirling ever since.</p>

<h3> What is one thing you never expected from being a baton twirler? </h3>
<p> Sabrina: Baton twirling has given me opportunities I never would have imagined, but I never expected that twirling would take places… literally! Because of twirling I have been able to go to Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, France and Peru! As a college twirler I’ve also gotten to attend a couple bowl games as well.</p>

<h3> It’s clear you’ve been a very successful twirler. What would you say is your biggest accomplishment? </h3>
<p> Sabrina: Oh my gosh, this is tough. I’ve had two goals for myself as a baton twirler: to become a feature twirler at a major university and win the title of College Miss Majorette of America (CMMOA). I feel beyond fortunate to have achieved both of those goals for myself. Twirling at the University of South Carolina gave me so many opportunities and I was able to be recognized at one of my final games for winning CMMOA. I will also never forget the moment I won CMMOA. The moment I won I burst into tears because I grew up wanting to achieve this goal, so when I did it felt so surreal.

<h3> Speaking of college twirling, how did you prepare for college twirling on a football field vs. competition twirling? </h3>
<p> Sabrina: These are two very different types of twirling. When you’re competing, the judges are focused on your technique, difficulty, and skill. But when you’re on the field, your primary goal is to entertain the crowd...and that is the best part. I love being able to twirl fire at night games because that always gets the audience excited. I think the best way to prepare for college twirling is to keep that in mind and always try to have fun because the audience will feed off that energy.

<h3> What is the best lesson you’ve learned from twirling? </h3>
<p> Sabrina: There have been so many times in my competitive career where I told myself that I would never win the title of CMMOA. There were times I just wanted to give up and accept the fact that I may never win. But, I continued to prepare and work harder because I knew this dream was worth chasing. With that being said, I would say the best lesson I learned from twirling would be if it’s worth it, work for it. Nothing great in life will always come to you easy, and that was clear to me as I competed in twirling. I am starting grad school in January at John Hopkins University and I think the lessons I have learned in twirling make me a better professional as well. </p>
