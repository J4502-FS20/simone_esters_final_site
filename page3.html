  <p>As a collegiate level baton twirler you represent the band, the university, and the sport of baton twirling at a variety of athletic and school events. Many people have seen these twirlers, but are unaware there is a national collegiate twirling championship each year.</P>

    <p>Twirling at the collegiate level in the dream of many young twirling across. Gillian Brooks, Blue Sapphire Feature Twirler at Pennsylvania State University, says “After competing in twirling my whole life, I always saw twirlers at football games and they looked like they were having so much fun performing. That’s what I dreamed of doing.”</p>

  <p> In July, thousands of collegiate twirlers from across the country come to the University of Notre Dame to compete for the chance to be named the nation’s top collegiate baton twirler. There are two main events of competition: Collegiate Halftime and Collegiate Downfield. </p>

  <p>Collegiate Halftime gives twirlers the chance to perform for two and half minutes and twirl one, two, or three batons. They have the freedom to use music that represents their school and emphasis is placed on the twirlers ability to entertain. </p>

  <p>The Collegiate Downfield event is meant to imitate a traditional performance at a football game and demonstrates the skills a twirler would use to go down the field during halftime.</p>
